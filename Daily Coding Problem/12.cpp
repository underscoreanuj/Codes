 *
 * Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
 * This problem was asked by Amazon.
 * There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
 * For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

    -----------------
    |   1, 1, 1, 1  |
    |   2, 1, 1     |
    |   1, 2, 1     |
    |   1, 1, 2     |
    |   2, 2        |
    -----------------

 *
 * What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.
